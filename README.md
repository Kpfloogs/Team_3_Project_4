# Team_3_Project_4 | Stroke Predictor
We plan to analyze a kaggle datasource around health factors that may cause a stroke. In our analysis we hope to uncover medical factors that lead to strokes, such as gender, is the patient has had heart disease, hypertension, etc. Then creating a user input menu of dropdowns that when using our supervised learning model will determine from the users inputs if they are likely to have a stroke.

## Data & Delivery

### Data Set
Kaggle Data Set | Stroke Prediction Dataset
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

    - SQlite
    - JavaScript
    - Plotly
    - HTML with CSS page
    - Render
    - Jupyter Notebook
    - JSON
    - Pickle
    - sklearn (train_test_split; StandardScaler, transform, OneHOT Encoder)
    - TensorFlow
    - D3

### Data Model Optimization
Our data was uploaded to a render page. 

### Machine Learning
We testing our data set using supervised machine learning. First we split our data into our features and target arrays. The split data was then processed into training and testingdataset, utilizing a random_state of 78. StandardScaler instantance as then created, fit, and scaled utilizing the transform fucntion.
```
# Split our preprocessed data into our features and target arrays
   y = stroke_df["stroke"]#.values
   X = stroke_df.drop(["stroke"],1)#.values

# Split the preprocessed data into a training and testing dataset
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=78)

# Create a StandardScaler instances
   scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit the StandardScaler
   X_scaler = scaler.fit(X_train)

# Scale the data
   X_train_scaled = X_scaler.transform(X_train)
   X_test_scaled = X_scaler.transform(X_test)
``` 

Our data was then inputed into a LogisticRegression model and a Random Forest model and the data was fit tested within each model. 

## Analysis
Our logistic regression model was the most accurate wtih a 94.86% accuracy rating. Our logistic regression model preformed only slightly better (.0814%) better than the random forest modeling. 

*Logistic Regression*
```
# Train a Logistic Regression model and print the model score
# Create the model
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   model = LogisticRegression()

# Fit the model to the training data. 
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)

   print(f"Training Data Score: {model.score(X_train, y_train)}")
   print(f"Testing Data Score: {model.score(X_test, y_test)}")

   print(f'Actual:\t\t{list(y_test[:10])}')
   print(f'Predicted:\t{list(model.predict(X_test[:10]))}')
```
Our data trained at a 95.97% training data score; with a testing data score of 94.86%

*Random Forest*
```
# Train a Random Forest Classifier model and print the model score
# Import a Random Forests classifier
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

   scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X_train)
   X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
   X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

   clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1).fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
   y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_scaled)

   print(f'Training Score: {clf.score(X_train_scaled, y_train)}')
   print(f'Testing Score: {clf.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)}')
```
Our data trained at 100% with a testing stcore of 94.78%.

### Visualizations

### Usage
***************Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.**************

### Future Adjustments

## ShoutOuts, License and Disclamimer
This is NOT medical advice. If you are concerned for your well-being please seek medical care, especially if you are experiencing any stroke like symptoms, please call 9-1-1 and seek emergency medical care.
